# ML-explainability-app

## ✅ Description
Designing black box machine learning algorithms are sometimes challenging and confusing to explain. But in reality, there are diffrenet ways to explain these models and also understand how each featue contributes to the accuracy of the model.
explainMyModel is an open source  webapp built to easily explain Supervised machine learning models merely by dragging and dropping without writing any code. 

## ✅ Technologies and libraries used
| Name  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Streamlit  |  *An open source app framework for building beautiful data and ML apps* |
| eli5  | *python library to debug ML classifier and expain thier predictions*  |
| pdpbox | *A python library used to visualize the impact of features on models* |
| shap | *A python library using game theoristic approach to explain outputs of ML models*|
| Pandas | |
| Numpy | |


## ✅ Features to implement
Currently, explainMyModel uses library **eli5** for Permutation Importance, **pdpbox** for Partial Dependency plot and **shap** for SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. Features to implement are;
* LIME 
* Comparing features with pdpbox
* Better UI
